1. Google Apps Script Web App (Recommended for simplicity)

Create a Google Apps Script that acts as a web service
Your website sends data via HTTP POST requests
No API keys needed, free tier is generous

2. Google Sheets API (More professional)

Use the official Google Sheets API v4
Requires OAuth 2.0 authentication or service account
Better for production applications

3. Third-party services

Services like Zapier, Make (formerly Integlio), or SheetDB
Easier setup but may have costs

Quick Setup with Google Apps Script
Would you like me to create a working example for you? I can build:

A Google Apps Script that receives data and writes it to your sheet
HTML/JavaScript code for your website to submit data to the script

This approach works great because:

No backend server needed
Free and simple to set up
Works directly with your Google Sheet
Can handle form submissions easily
